        <div>

          <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
          <p>In this project, we implement fundamental graphics rasterization techniques for Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG), including drawing single-color triangles, anti-aliasing by super-sampling, linear rigid-body transformations, barycentric coordinates, pixel sampling and level sampling for texture mapping. The details of each part are below.</p>

          <h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

          <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

          <p>In this part, we implement single-color triangle rasterization, given an SVG to draw. The <code>draw</code> function delegates its rendering method to each element on the screen. For example, points and lines are rendered pixel by pixel with a provided <code>fill_pixel</code> function. The triangles are rendered using the triangle rasterization function given coordinates for the three triangle vertices. More complex shapes, like polygons, are rendered with composite triangles.</p>

          <p>Given the three triangle vertices, we first calculate the bounding box for the given triangle to avoid sampling every pixel on screen. We take the smallest <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value, and largest <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> value. Screen space pixels are only iterated and checked within this bounding box.
          </p>

          <p>
            A helper function called <code>line_equation</code> takes in 3 points as well as a Boolean value that represents the winding (direction of the normal) to be used, and returns a <code>float</code> to indicate the position of the third point in relation to the vector formed from point 0 (P0) to point 1 (P1). The order that the points are passed as arguments to the function determines their numbering as point 0, 1, or 2. By default, the normal is always taken to the left of the vector from P0 to P1. If the winding bool is set to true, meaning a “clockwise” winding, then the normal is instead taken to the right.
          </p>

          <div align="middle">
            <table style="width:100%;">
              <tr>
                <td align="center">
                  <img src="./images/t1_img1.png" align="middle" width="50%;" />
                  <figcaption align="middle">A point to the right of the line will return a <b>NEGATIVE</b> value from the <code>line_equation</code> function.</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td align="center">
                  <img src="./images/t1_img2.png" align="middle" width="50%;" />
                  <figcaption align="middle">A point to the left of the line will return a POSITIVE value from the <code>line_equation</code> function.</figcaption>
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>The points passed to the <code>rasterize_triangle </code>function are first passed into the <code>line_equation</code> function in order to determine the winding. This initial function call assumes winding to be false, meaning the default normal direction of left is used, implying a counterclockwise winding. If the float returned is positive, then the bool is left unchanged. If the float returned is negative, the bool is set to true, and is used for the remainder of the <code>rasterize_triangles</code> function calls. </p>

          <p>The <code>line_equation </code>function is called 3 more times with the updated bool, and with the points in order P0 & P1, P1 & P2, and P2 & P0. Each time the <code>line_equation</code> function is called, 0.5 is added to the x and y values of the points to ensure accurate sampling at the centre of each screen space point. If all three checks return a positive float, then the screen space point is within the triangle and is rendered using the <code>fill_pixel </code>function.</p>

            </table>
          </div>

          <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>

          <p>Supersampling is useful as it increases the effective resolution at which sampling and rasterization occurs at. This allows us to capture higher frequency data with less loss and aliasing, as we effectively increase the frequency rate that we sample at. This is most noticeable at the edges of objects as this is where high frequency colour changes are most likely to occur. This is costly however, as it means we are essentially just rendering a scene at a higher resolution.</p>

          <p>The rasterization pipeline had to be heavily modified to support this. The following functions were modified, and a brief description of each of their purpose and changes are listed below. The key changes were:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The sample buffer had to be increased in size to allow for supersampling. E.g. if the supersample rate was 9, each pixel in the frame buffer corresponds to 9 in the sample buffer, making the sample buffer 9 times the size of the frame buffer.</li>
            <li>When a rasterization function for a triangle was called, the number of samples taken, and hence line checks done, was repeated the same number of times as the supersample rate. Instead of calling the <code>fill_pixel</code> function, the colour was written directly to the supersample buffer.</li>
            <li>When <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> was called at the end of each frame, the colours were averaged over an area in the sample buffer corresponding to a single framebuffer or screen pixel.</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>rgb_framebuffer_target</code></h4>
          <p>This is an array of length 3 * width * height. Each screen pixel needs 3 locations, 1 for R, G, & B. This is where the final RGB data for the frame buffer is written, and what is ultimately written to the display.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>sample_buffer</code></h4>
          <p>Array of length 3 * width * height * <i>sample rate</i>. Supersampling effectively just increases the screen resolution at which we rasterize. As such, we need to create a sample buffer that’s <code>sample_rate</code> times larger than the regular frame buffer. </p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>set_sample_rate</code></h4>
          <p>When the user first presses either + or -, <code>set_sample_rate</code> changes the size of the <code>sample_buffer</code> to <code>width * height * sample_rate</code>, and sets all the elements to be of the colour white.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>set_framebuffer_target</code></h4>
          <p>This sets where the frame buffer is, which is where the display is drawn from. It also resizes the sample buffer, which is required to implement supersampling.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>clear_buffers</code></h4>
          <p>As the name suggests, this simply fills both the sample and frame buffer with all white pixels, essentially clearing them.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>rasterize_triangle</code> <i>(and other triangle rasterisation functions) </i></h4>
          <p>When the sample rate is 1, a basic line check and <code>fill_pixel</code> method is implemented, as discussed in Task 1. When the sample rate is greater than 1, each screen space point is then broken into the corresponding number of sample points, and then the same line check logic as Task 1 is done for each of these points. The difference is that if a point passes the line test, then the colour is placed into the sample buffer instead of calling <code>fill_pixel</code> directly. The <code>fill_pixel</code> functionality is replaced and discussed in the <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> function.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>fill_pixel</code></h4>
          <p>The <code>fill_pixel</code> function was modified to place the same colour into all corresponding points in the sample buffer if the sampling rate was greater than 1.  This was done so that points and lines would still be rendered correctly with a sampling rate over 1. When the sample rate is greater than 1, functions that rasterize triangles instead write directly to the sample buffer, bypassing the <code>fill_pixel</code> function. The final <code>fill_pixel</code> functionality is instead included in the <code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> function, which as described below, fills the pixel in the frame buffer by averaging corresponding points in the sample buffer.</p>

          <h4 align="middle"><code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code></h4>
          <p><code>resolve_to_framebuffer</code> is called whenever a frame is updated. For a sample rate of 1, it will take the colours directly from the sample buffer and place it into the frame buffer. For a sample rate over 1, it will instead average the colour over a number of colours in the sample buffer. The colours are summed together over the number of points, which is determined by the sample rate, and then finally written to the framebuffer. </p>

          <br />
          <p>Below are some images comparing the supersampling rates and their effect on rasterising triangles. Take note of the pixel inspector, which is purposely placed where the effect is most pronounced.</p>

          <div align="middle">
            <table style="width:100%;">

          <p>Some of the exact precision of each image is lost due to compression, but the pixel inspector shows the key differences between the four different supersampling rates. The point being observed in the pixel inspector is the rightmost side of the centre red triangle.</p>

          <p>There is a large jump from 1 to 4, and the white “gaps” between the red pixels are now being properly sampled. With a sample rate of 1, it is much more likely that a skinny point of a triangle will not be sampled correctly, as the screen space pixel will simply be nearer to the background than a point on the triangle. With supersampling, more pixels nearby are taken into account, leading to a more accurate recreation of the image. Supersampling is essentially rasterizing at a higher resolution, and then downscaling the rasterized image to fit a smaller screen size. This smoothing effect created can be seen slightly more with the supersample rates of 9 and 16. </p>


          <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Transforms</h3>

          <p>In this task, we implement three transformations defined by the SVG <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform" target="_blank" style="font-weight: bold;">specification</a>: translate, rotate, and scale. These linear operations to transform an SVG element are represented as 3x3 matrices. We set the last row of each transformation matrix to <code>[0 0 1]</code> because we use homogeneous coordinates.</p>

          <p>The unchanged image using transformation is shown below.</p>

          <div align="center">
            <img src="./images/task_3.png" align="middle" width="30%;" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Sample SVG using transformations.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>The updated version of the robot image is shown in the image below.</p>

          <div align="center">

            <figcaption align="middle">Updated SVG using transformations.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>In the imagea above of the updated robot, we update the color of the robot to green and change the positions of the arms by modifying the SVG transformations in the <code>my_robot.svg</code> file. To move the left arm, we add a 90-degree rotation in counter-clockwise direction for the lower part of the arm. To move the right arm from extended position to down position, we add a clockwise 90-degree rotation for both parts of the arm.</p>

          <h2 align="middle">Section II: Sampling</h2>

          <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>

          <p>In this task, we implement barycentric coordinates. Barycentric coordinates represent points <code>(x, y)</code> inside a triangle in terms of 3 scalar values: <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code>. If the weights add up to 1, then the point <code>(x, y)</code> is inside the triangle. An example triangle with barycentric coordinates is shown in the image below.</p>

          <div align="center">
            <img src="./images/task_4_barycentric_coordinate_triangle.png" align="middle" width="30%;" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Barycentric coordinate (x, y) inside a triangle ABC.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>Barycentric coordinates linearly interpolate values from 3 triangle vertices. If a vertex represents a specific color, the <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code> represent proportional color weights. As a result, the color inside a triangle is linearly interpolated at each point, proportionally to how close the point is to each vertex. We use the line equations from Task 1 to check if a point is inside a triangle and to find the numeric values of <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code>. We use the equations shown in the image below.</p>
          <div align="center">
            <img src="./images/task_4_equations.png" align="middle" width="30%;" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Equations for the barycentric coordinates.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>The result of linearly interpolating colors inside triangles is shown in the image below.</p>

            <figcaption align="middle">Example SVG using barycentric coordinates (supersample rate 1 per pixel).</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>We also add supersampling to rasterize interpolated color triangles at a higher sampling rate, using the larger <code>sample_buffer</code> described in Part 2. The result of linearly interpolating colors inside triangles with a higher sampling rate is shown in the image below. The border of the color circle is smoother with the higher sampling rate.</p>

          <h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>

          <p>
            In this task, we implement full-resolution rasterization of texture images using two kinds of interpolation: nearest-neighbor and bi-linear. The given texture image contains a color at each triangle vertex in the image coordinate system <code>(x and y)</code>. We convert each point from the image coordinate system <code>(x, y)</code> to the texture coordinate system <code>(u, v)</code>.
          </p>

          <p>First, we use the barycentric coordinate interpolation of the three triangle vertices, given by three points <code>(x0, y0)</code>, <code>(x1, y1)</code>, and <code>(x2, y2)</code>. We find the weights <code>alpha</code>, <code>beta</code>, and <code>gamma</code> using the line equations and formulas shown in the image in Part 4 above and compute the texture coordinate <code>(u, v)</code>. Since the coordinate <code>(u, v)</code> is normalized between 0 and 1, we then scale the <code>(u, v)</code> sample point by the size of the texture image to get the texel coordinate. We use the full-resolution width and height of the texture map to get the texel coordinate. With the nearest-neighbor filtering, we convert the floating-point texel to its nearest integer equivalent by dropping the floating-point precision. </p>

          <p>With the bi-linear filtering, we check the 4 closest texels, surrounding the texture point <code>(u, v)</code>. First, we round the <code>(u, v)</code> texel to the nearest integer. Then, we check the upper and lower boundaries and keep all 4 texels inside the texture bounds. Next, we determine the offsets <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, as shown in the image below.</p>

          <div align="center">
            <img src="./images/task_5_bilinear_sampling.png" align="middle" width="30%;" />
            <figcaption align="middle">Texels surrounding the sample point shown in red.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>Finally, we linearly interpolate the color values between the two top texels and the two bottom texels, then interpolate between the two resulting colors vertically. The steps for the procedure are shown in the image below. </p>

          <div align="center">

            <figcaption align="middle">The procedure steps for linearly interpolating between 4 sample points.</figcaption>
          </div>

          <p>Examples below show two images: the left image shows the nearest-neighbor sampling and the right image shown the bi-linear sampling on the same full-resolution texture map with supersampling rate 1 per pixel.</p>

              <tr>

                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>The bi-linear sampling creates a smoother transition between colors, making the letters in the right texture image shown above easier to read.</p>

          <p>We also implement supersampling for texture maps, averaging <code>N</code> samples over a pixel in the output image for anti-aliasing, similarly to Part 2. The results below show two images: the left image shows the nearest-neighbor sampling and the right image shown the bi-linear sampling on the same full-resolution texture map with sampling rate 16.</p>

              </tr>
            </table>
          </div>

          <p>Anti-aliasing at the supersampling rate of 16 per pixel creates a smoothing effects and removes jaggies, which are most pronoun in the Berkeley logo image on the left above. High supersampling rate creates an almost indistinguishable smooth images, as seen in the two examples above.</p>
